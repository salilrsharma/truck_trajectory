# Trajectory dataset for the Netherlands

We use the trajectory dataset for the Netherlands to understand the lane change behavior of truck drivers. The dataset can be downloaded from https://data.4tu.nl/repository/uuid:6be1aefa-0803-4ce2-91b2-caaa7982abcd.

This repository contains the codes used to understand discretionary and mandatory lane change behavior of truck drivers.
